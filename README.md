# recursion

Recursion can be a more readable and simplistic way to solve some problems rather than using iteration. A tradeoff is that recursion takes up more memory than iterative solutions due to the many execution contexts created by the repeated function calls. 

This repo contains exercises in recursion:
- recursive merge sort
- recursive fibonacci (and its iterative version)
